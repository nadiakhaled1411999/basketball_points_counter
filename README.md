# basketball_points_counter

 Developed a Basketball Points Counter App using Flutter and Bloc for state management. 

Incorporated buttons to increment points for two teams (Team A and Team B) with 1, 2, or 3 points.

Implemented a reset button to reset the points for both teams. 

Designed a responsive layout with a grid-based system for buttons and a clean UI to display points.  

Utilized Cubit to manage state and dynamically update the points as the buttons are pressed.
